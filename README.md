### :balloon: Overview :trophy:

[Balloon Cup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5716/balloon-cup) is a two-player board game published by KOSMOS games in 2003.   This is my implementation of the game, both because I love the game and though it would be an interesting challenge.   To play the officially licensed online version, visit [yucata.de](https://www.yucata.de/en/GameInfo/BalloonCup).

> In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. 
> When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade 3 otherwise 
> useless cubes for 1 they can use. The first player to earn 3 trophy cards is the winner!
>
> Each player has a hand of eight balloon cards. The players play their balloons on mountain or plain hops. Players play their high-valued 
> balloons on the mountains and their low- valued balloons on the plains.
> 
> Players usually play their balloons on their side of the hops, but winds (and cunning) can cause them to play on their opponent's side, 
> a move that can ruin their opponent's plans.
